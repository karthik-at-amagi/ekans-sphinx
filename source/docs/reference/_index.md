# Reference

```{tip}
This is a good place to integrate the Mirage API description or any other
generated reference material.
```

If your project has an API, configuration knobs, or other low-level reference
material, link to it or embed it here. Sphinx can pull in Python docstrings via
`autodoc`, include OpenAPI descriptions through `sphinxcontrib-openapi`, or
publish pre-generated HTML by dropping it into `build/html` during the build.
Anything static can also live in `_static` and be linked with a standard
`{download}` role, so you have plenty of options for wiring deep reference
content into the navigation.
