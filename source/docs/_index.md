# Documentation

```{note}
This page exists so you always have a high-level landing area, even when the
rest of the content grows.
```

The Sphinx build walks through each folder under `source/docs/`, reads the
`index.md` files, and uses the embedded `toctree` directives to wire up the
navigation automatically. Treat this page as the briefest overview of how the
sections hang together.
