# Newspulse

This folder holds everything related to Newspulse: release notes, operational
runbooks, and product briefs. Structure it however you like—the parent
`index.md` in this directory already exposes the local `toctree`, so any `.md`
file that you add here (or in child folders) can show up in the sidebar.
