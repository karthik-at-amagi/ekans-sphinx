# Live News

Document the Live News surfaces here—ingestion jobs, update cadence, alerting
rules, or anything else the newsroom needs to know. This is a normal MyST page,
so you can embed code blocks, callouts, or even include reusable snippets with
`{include}` to keep overlapping sections in sync.
